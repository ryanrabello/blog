title: How to Make Mustang Lights Using Digital Logic
author: Ryan Rabello
---

This past quarter I took a course in Digital Logic. I loved learning about how to create systems that solely used simple logic to complete tasks.

## Finished product
`Insert video here`

## Goals

1. Recreate mustang tail-lights with animation. Specific sub goals are as follows.
    * System inputs are left (L), right (R), and brake (B).
    * System outputs are each of the six lights.
    * Appropriate turn signal animation should be enabled when either L or R is high.
    * Turn signal overrides brake.
    * Emergency flashers are on when both L and R are high.
    * B overrides Emergency Flasher.
2. Minimize the number of IC's used in the final version. (We ended up using only 7).
