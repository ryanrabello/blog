Hey there,

I'm Ryan.  I am currently working on a Computer Engineering Degree at Walla Walla University. I enjoy hiking, singing and spending time with family. <!--more--> As you probably guessed by this blog I also enjoy computer programming. At this moment my primary focus is on Web Development. I currently work on the web team for the Associated Students of Walla Walla University, ASWWU for short. In short I get paid to do what I love.

Checkout my [resum√©](http://rabello.info/resume), [portfolio](http://rabello.info/portfolio) or peruse through the rest of this blog for more info.

You may have noticed that there aren't any other posts here. Between work, college and getting enough sleep I find that it is hard to do some leisurely blogging on the side so bare with me as the posts role out (or as they don't).
